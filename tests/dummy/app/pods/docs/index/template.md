# What is ember-phone-input?

It is an ember.js addon which is a component backed by a service.

The component aims at providing easy input / validation of international phone numbers, while the service takes care of loading the scripts.

It wraps the well maintained javascript lib [intl-tel-input](https://github.com/jackocnr/intl-tel-input). The plugin itself is based on Google's [libphonenumber library](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber).
